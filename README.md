# THE CORTEX CHRONICLES, CHAPTER 8 - The Nine Lives of Nyx Sterling

![GameScreenshot](art/title.png)

Developed for the Game Creator's Club at Lusofona University.
This month, the theme is Cats

This is a part of what I hope will be "The Cortex Chronicles" - I want all the games I do for the Game Creator's Club this year to be linked together, hence this idea.
I also want to use a different engine on every entry, so let's see how that goes! :)

This time, I'm using [Defold](https://defold.com/).
